One of the great things about a small charity is how clearly you can see and feel the impact of our projects. They’re small numbers but they’re very real, and they make a big difference!

So far, we have built or improved water systems in 6 rural schools.

<!-- I think most impactful would be some content from the children/communities – pictures and quotes about how they’ve felt the difference. -->
