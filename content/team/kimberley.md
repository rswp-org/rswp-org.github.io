Hey there! I'm Kimberley, and I joined as the Safeguarding and Risk Management Lead in 2023.

In my role, I help to ensure that our people, decisions, and projects are safe for the children and adults in locations where we operate. My background is in safeguarding, child protection, and law, and for the past 26 years I've worked in the non-profit, government, and international NGO sectors. I am delighted to have the opportunity to work with a brilliant team at rswp and contribute to this important mission.
