Hey! I’m Will and I have the privilege of leading our amazing board of trustees. 

I’ve been part of RSWP since 2014 and I’m heavily involved in leading our projects and partnerships.

I work at Save the Children International and study part-time at the Water Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC), Loughborough University.
