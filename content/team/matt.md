I'm Matt, I joined the board of trustees in 2022 and took over rswp's financial planning, controlling and reporting. 

I work directly with local partners to understand their handling of finances, drive efficiencies in uses of funding, improve our processes and keep rswp accountable to its stakeholders.

I trained as a Chartered Accountant (CA), and was an active member of the ICAEWâ€™s London Student Society where I was Treasurer for a couple of years.
