Hi I’m Isobel, and I joined the board of trustees as Fundraising and Communications Lead in 2023.

My focus at the moment is building our brand and communications strategy – basically what we stand for and how we share this with people. My background is in marketing, comms and brand management and for the last 5 years I’ve done this work at Save the Children.
