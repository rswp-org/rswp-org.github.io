Hi, I'm Anabella and I joined the board of trustees as Data and Evidence Lead in 2023. 

My responsibilities include designing and implementing data collection and analytic processes and measuring the impact of rswp's work.

I have worked for over 5 years in data-specific roles in the aid sector. Currently I am a Data Lead at Save the Children International, focusing on HR and organisational structure. My degree is in Economics and Philosophy.
