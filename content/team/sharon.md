Hello, I'm Sharon, and I took on the role of Engineering Lead on rswp's board of trustees in 2023.

My responsibilities include working closely with rural schools and partners, offering them technical guidance to ensure they have access to clean and safe water.

I hold a degree in Water Resources Engineering and am currently employed at ATRO E&M. I play an active role there in advancing Green Infrastructure solutions for effective stormwater management.
