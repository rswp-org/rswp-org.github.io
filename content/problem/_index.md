Nearly half of schools in rural Uganda lack basic drinking water services – and over the last decade this has got worse instead of better.

We all need water to function, and we all know that children are no different. The problem isn’t difficult to understand: healthy children can’t grow up, let alone concentrate and learn in school, without access to clean drinking water, basic sanitation and hygiene services.

<!-- Lay out stats as an infographic/bullet points -->
* 46% of rural schools lack basic drinking water services – that’s 7.2 million children
* 88% of rural schools don’t have basic hygiene services – that’s 14 million children

Uganda is also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. Higher temperatures are expected to increase the severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, placing additional stresses on available water resources and agriculture<!-- (reference, p.12) -->. This is one of the reasons why our small charity chooses to focus its efforts here.
