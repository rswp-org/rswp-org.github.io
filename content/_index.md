description: "local, sustainable water services for primary schools in rural Uganda"
---
We are a really small charity focused on children’s right to clean water. 

We work with our partners in Uganda to build water services in local schools. 

With your support we hope to build a future where all children in Uganda have access to basic water services. 

And we’re starting one school at a time.
