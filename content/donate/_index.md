[Reach out]({{< ref "/reach-out" >}}) to us with your questions if you need further advice about donation options. 

Thank you so much for considering supporting our work – as a small charity we welcome any donation, big or small!

100% of donations go towards our projects – there are no salaries and our costs are only related to project delivery.

There are lots of ways you can get involved or support RSWP.

* Donate every month – regular donations are so valuable, as it means we can plan our funding into the future. Just £5 a month makes a massive difference to our projects!

* Give a one-off donation – any contribution makes a huge difference to us, so if regular donations aren’t your thing we’d still really appreciate your support with a one-off gift. And we’ll let you know where it goes!
* Fundraise for us – we’d love to be the charity you run, bake or fundraise for! Let us know if we can help with any information or ideas!
* Stay in touch – we have just started an email newsletter (only every 3 months, we won’t be in touch too often!) and we’d love for more people to be part of our community!
* Find out more – we’re a small but very dedicated team. If you get in touch with a question or idea we will be very happy to have a chat!
