If you’ve skipped what the problem is, you can read more [here]({{< ref "/problem" >}}), but we’re so pleased you’re ready to find out about the solution!

Our number 1 goal is to protect children’s education by improving their access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services. We think this is the best way to have a sustainable impact on children’s futures and their communities.

Our solution has two approaches – looking to improve the situation now and prevent the problem in the future. 

## now
Helping to build water services ASAP.

Through our partnerships, we provide funding and support for locally-led water projects working to realise communities’ human right to water. This means ensuring people have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water - and that water services are well-managed and sustainable.
 
We focus on building both physical resources, like water sources, storage and treatment, and also sharing the knowledge, skills, and systems needed to keep water supplies running. 

## in the future
Building long term partnerships.
Although we have expertise in water and hygiene services, we know that local organisations understand their communities’ needs the best. So our solution also focuses on building partnerships to help local organisations strengthen and scale their own work in this area. It’s this that makes our projects truly sustainable.
